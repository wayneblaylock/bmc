            <p id="thesis"> There exists a clear and defined route that leads to a better life. A tried and true system to give you everything you want. Uncontrolled ambition and vague hopes do not yield results, but definition, planning, and pursuit will.</p>

<h2>Defining the Vision</h2>
<p>I once knew a man who seemed so successful in life. He had a fulfilling career, a great family, and meaningful relationships. He truly seemed happy. I was lucky to have him as somewhat of a mentor.</p>
<p>One day he shared some advice that I will never forget. He remarked that success comes down to “squeaky clean planning, followed by minutes of action.” I am convinced that this phrase can change every aspect of someone's life.</p>
<p>Before beginning this process of planning and action there is one prerequisite. You need vision. Vision, in the sense we are talking about, means to see the end.</p>
<p>Everyone has ideas and wishes for how their life could be, but you must define what you really want. What things matter most to you, and what will really make you happy.</p>
<p>On this topic, author and blogger Michael Hyatt wrote, “The more clarity you have the better. Visualize it as if it were already a reality. Now write it down with as much specificity as you can.”</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your vision can and likely will change over time. It doesn't have to be perfect. It is far better to have a defined vision that evolves than to wander aimlessly through life. You need vision to channel your efforts into accomplishing what you want.</p>
<h2>Create a Strategy</h2>
<p>Goals are tools, allowing you to strategically work toward the vision. One successful businessman and religious leader M. Russel Ballard once remarked, “I am so thoroughly convinced that if we don’t set goals in our life and learn how to master the techniques of living to reach our goals, we can reach a ripe old age and look back on our life only to see that we reached but a small part of our full potential.”</p>
<p>Everyone has only so much time and resources. Chasing after your vision uses this time and resources. This is especially true when you don’t have a strategy.</p>
<p>To develop a strategy, consider the 80/20 rule.This rule states that roughly 80% of outcomes result from 20% of the possible causes. Though this rule was first used in economics, you can observe it everywhere.</p>
<p>Author Cal Newport cleverly applied this rule to goals. In his book, Deep Work, he writes, “many different activities can contribute to your achieving these goals. The [80/20 rule], however, reminds us that the most important 20 percent or so of these activities provide the bulk of the benefit.”</p>
<p>As you consider your vision and the changes it would require you to make, consider which changes will have the biggest impact. A strategic goal is one that focuses on the most crucial changes. This maximizes the progress you can make with your limited amount of time and resources.</p>
<p>Now, with a strategy, you can flesh out your goals. This is where SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timebound) come into play. Choose specific metrics that you can strive for, and can use to measure your progress against.</p>
<h2>Make Plans</h2>
<p>As a boy attending a leadership camp I was once posed with the question: “How do you eat an elephant?” I was caught off guard by this strange question, and couldn’t imagine how it related to our lesson on goal setting.</p>
<p>I was equally surprised by the simplicity of the answer: “One bite at a time.” This isn’t some kind of joke or trick question. It simply teaches an important truth. To accomplish big things, you need to take it piece by piece. Step by step.</p>
<p>Previously, we outlined the importance of defining a vision and coming up with strategic goals to get us there. Now all that’s needed is a plan. A plan’s purpose is to break a goal down into specific actions.</p>
<p>Some goals might already be a plan. If you set a goal to read 10 pages every day, you are pretty much there. Further planning may include where and when you will do this reading.</p>
<p>Softer goals may require more planning, and that makes it even more important. For example, wanting to get into shape is a soft goal. It’s not something you can just do on a given day, rather it is the result of recurring action.</p>
<p>If getting into shape is your goal, it is crucial to make specific actionable plans. You could plan to workout 30 minutes each weekday, and even plan what muscle groups you will hit each day. Make plans for when and where you will work out.</p>
<p>The important thing is that your goals are supported by something you can do. On any given day, you know what actions you should be taking. You know whether you made progress or not. Doing this makes you accountable to yourself, and that improves performance.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>“Squeaky clean planning followed by minutes of action,” is a powerful and effective way to better yourself and your life. Decide what matters most to you, and define the future you want. Set strategic goals, and make plans to achieve them. This planning lays a solid foundation for you to build the life you want.</p>
