## Actionable Goals
In the words of Benjamin Franklin, “By failing to plan, you are planning to fail.” The way you set your goals can set you up for success or failure in many ways.

Before taking action, you should have a strategy to make your efforts most effective. If you haven’t read the previous article, “The Pathway to Better”, you may want to review it to understand some fundamentals of goal setting.

When transitioning from planning to doing, you should recognize whether you are working towards a hard goal or soft goal. A hard goal is specific and concrete. You can measure your progress towards achieving it. A soft goal is general, abstract, and hard to measure.

Progress towards soft goals is driven entirely by motivation, and motivation is not something to rely on. You can’t control it. To achieve greater success, any soft goal should be backed by harder concrete goals.

These hard goals need to have specific measurable plans in place that lead to your desired destination. For example, if you want to complete a big project, you could make a goal to work on it for 2 hours every Saturday. This enforces that progress will be made, as opposed to the soft goal of finishing the project.

In an article for the Harvard Business Review, Sabina Nawaz wrote, “We’re indoctrinated to - and rewarded for - thinking big, not executing small.” Her article lines out how consistently executing small changes in our lives leads to big results. Goals are attained by building habits of consistently doing the work.
## Taking Action
Following through with the plans you set is a skill. Like any skill, you can get better at it with practice. So, once all the planning is done and you have a clear path, just jump into it. Expect to fail and make mistakes, but push forward and do your best.

One way to be more consistent in working toward your goals is recording progress. Get a notebook or journal, and record each day if you followed through on your plans. I call this accounting, and it can be as simple as checking off some boxes. It hardly takes a minute to do, but if you can be 100% consistent at this all other habits will improve.

You can also be accountable to friends. Let others know what goals and habits you are working on, and keep them updated. This is especially good to do with a friend who has similar goals as you, or when you’re on a team that is working towards the same goal.

Ultimately, success takes practice and persistence. Keep planning, and keep working. Learn and adjust as you go. Improvement is a process not an event. You can only fail by giving up.
## Tough Times / Burnout
Inevitably, making positive changes in your life will not be easy. Sometimes you will feel motivated. Other times you will feel burnt out. This is normal, and you can get through it. Sometimes you just have to ride out the storm, and it will eventually pass.

We tend to be really hard on ourselves, especially when we are learning something new or working towards a big goal. Consider hiking a mountain as an analogy. As you work your way up the trail, some parts will be steeper than other parts. When you need a break, it is totally acceptable to stop and catch your breath. Taking a water break does not mean you have failed.

Similarly, when things get hard and you need some time to rest, it doesn't mean you’ve failed. You have to take care of yourself first, and you can keep working toward something better when you’re ready. You can even use rest time for some planning. Reevaluate your goals and plans. Look for what’s not working, and come up with a solution.

At the same time, you should be aware of momentum. An object in motion stays in motion because of momentum. Taking a break can make it harder to start again, so try to keep as much momentum as you can.
## Celebration
Celebrating success is an important and overlooked part of the goal setting process. People tend to move the goalpost further away as they progress. We often don’t realize when we are doing it, but this tendency can kill our motivation fast. You are likely doing better than you realize.

Author Darius Foroux wrote, “While discipline is a key factor to getting things done, there are two other things people often neglect: Time. And small victories.”

Real meaningful change takes time. You have to be patient and persistent. As you go along, look back from time to time to soak in how far you’ve come. Find ways to celebrate and reward yourself for all the hard work, then keep going.
## Conclusion
Success really comes down to a combination of planning and taking action. As you practice setting goals, building habits, and overcoming obstacles, you will make progress toward your goals. Additionally, you will improve at the goal setting process, setting yourself up for even more future success.
