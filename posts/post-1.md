## What Really is Masculinity
Let's dive into the topic of masculinity. This subject sparks strong opinions and misunderstandings, so it's crucial to first establish a clear definition.

A quick google search will give you a definition from the Oxford English Dictionary: “mas·cu·lin·i·ty; noun; qualities or attributes regarded as characteristic of men or boys.” That seems to fit with what we usually think of masculinity as, but there are some details to consider.

Masculinity may be defined by its relation to men, but it is relevant to everybody. Masculinity has an impact on everyone, both through their actions and the actions of others. It may relate to people differently, depending on the person’s background and circumstances, but everyone is affected.
## Is Masculinity Bad
Today there is much emphasis on “toxic masculinity”. This term has been greatly overused, to the point where it has deviated from its intended meaning. Some masculine tendencies are indeed detrimental and need to be addressed, but the phrase “toxic masculinity” is used on at least two extremes: 1) To rationalize and excuse harmful behavior, and 2) To shame men unfairly.

With so much focus on “toxic masculinity”, it is important to note that masculinity itself isn’t toxic. Masculinity is not bad. It’s also hard to say that it’s good. Masculine tendencies are more like tools, which can be used to accomplish good or bad.

A really great explanation comes from Randy Flood. He wrote an article about masculinity where he says: “It’s perplexing how guys who love a garage full of specific tools for each unique repair often only have a two-pound hammer of anger in their emotional toolbox. To lead fulfilling lives, men require more tools.”

One of the main points of Flood’s article is that masculinity is toxic when it is rigid and inflexible; when we don’t have enough “tools”. 
## Attributes of Constructive Masculinity
In contrast, masculinity is constructive when it is versatile and balanced. When we work to better ourselves and develop new skills, we are embodying constructive masculinity.

So, where do we start? Anywhere. Just have something that you are consciously working to improve, and you will live a better life, as will everyone around you. 

Some masculine attributes to consider working on are: Strength; manifested in a variety of ways, Resilience; getting up every time you fall, Creativity; finding solutions to difficult problems, Leadership; through service, and Humility; to keep everything in check.
## Conclusion
Masculinity should be a good thing, and it can be if we each pursue it. As we work to improve ourselves, becoming more versatile and balanced, we can positively impact our life, and the lives of everyone around us.

The journey to a more constructive masculinity begins anywhere, with any aspect one wishes to develop. Just pick something, learn about it, and live it. Take the time now to ask yourself “What do I need to work on?”
