## The Culture on Masculinity
When mentioning masculinity, there’s a good chance you think of another word: Toxic. Around 2014, the term “toxic masculinity” surged out of obscurity, and it has since become quite common. Actually, it has become too common, no longer retaining its actual meaning.

One writer, Sarah Vallie, offers some background on this subject. She says, “The term originally came about during the late 20th century men’s movements to describe narrow ideas of masculinity that were holding men back instead of empowering them. They considered toxic masculinity a characteristic of immature men who had not yet found their deep, spiritual masculinity.”

This is quite different from its usage today. What once had a deep genuine meaning is now a buzzword, often used to accomplish two extremes: to shame men and masculinity, or to rationalize and excuse harmful behavior. The term “toxic masculinity” both hurts men and serves as a scapegoat, enabling men to hurt others.
## A Better Outlook
Though many toxic traits can be associated with masculinity, this does not mean masculinity itself is toxic. Author and blogger Allie Stuckey outlined the contrast well when she said, “The same masculine traits that bring destruction, also defeat tyranny. The traits that foster greed also build economies. The traits that drive men to take foolish risks, also drive men to take heroic risks. The answer to toxic masculinity isn’t less masculinity. It’s better masculinity.”

Similarly, Randy Flood, director of a Men's Resource Center, said, “Masculinity, in and of itself, is natural, good, and necessary… Positive masculinity is how masculine energy—when consciously-calibrated, wisely-timed, and smartly-appropriated—is courageously life-giving, boldly empowering, and fiercely impactful to individual men and everyone else in their lives. Conversely, toxic masculinity is extreme, injurious, ill-timed, and poorly-appropriated.”

Masculinity is not a bad thing. Our culture needs to move away from looking down on it and instead focus on directing it towards accomplishing good. Allie Stuckey in the same video even suggests that, “The growing problem in today's society isn’t that men are too masculine, it’s that they aren’t masculine enough.” Men should not be ashamed of their masculinity, rather they should seek to develop it into something strong and constructive.
## Constructive Masculinity
The greatest opposer of toxic masculinity is not shame or femininity, but constructive masculinity. Constructive masculinity is not weak or permissive, but strong and focused. It takes work and time to develop, but is good for society.

There are so many attributes of masculinity that are positive. Examples include strength, ambition, resilience, and self mastery. As men invest in developing many of these traits, they become well rounded and capable of great things.

Being well balanced and versatile is crucial to keeping masculinity constructive. Richard Reeves, author of “Of Boys and Men” wrote, “the first headmaster of Stowe School, a private boy’s school in England, described his goal as cultivating men who would be ‘acceptable at a dance and invaluable in a shipwreck.’”

Reeves continues that, “... Maturity means among many other things, an ability to calibrate your behavior in a way that renders it appropriate to the circumstance.” Boys become men as they develop a variety of skills. Being versatile allows them to use the right tools for the right job.

Randy Flood wrote, “It’s perplexing how guys who love a garage full of specific tools for each unique repair often only have a two-pound hammer of anger in their emotional toolbox. To lead fulfilling lives, men require more tools.” Masculinity is toxic when it is rigid and fixed. A bigger “toolbox” is therefore the solution.
## Conclusion
Masculinity is a good thing, and we should see it as such. Creating a better culture and understanding of masculinity starts with individuals. The journey to a more constructive masculinity begins anywhere, with any aspect one wishes to develop. Just pick something, learn about it, and live it.
